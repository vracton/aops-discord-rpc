This presence has been created for use with the [PreMiD](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/premid/agjnjboanicjcpenljmaaigopkgdnihi) chrome extension.

First, setup PreMiD with the following [tutorial](https://docs.premid.app/en/install).

Unfortunately, this is not available on the PreMiD catalog, so you will have to host a local version of the presence in order to use this.

To do this follow [this tutorial](https://docs.premid.app/en/dev/presence).
After cloning the project, create a new folder under `./websites/A/`, and put the contents of this repo in there. Then compile with `npx pmd`.  You can then load the presence by doing [this](https://docs.premid.app/en/dev/presence#loading-your-presence).
